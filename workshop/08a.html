 * -----

 * Let's look at our survival requirement now.
 * "Any living cell with 2 or 3 neighbors should survive."
 * This is a different sort of requirement, 
 * so let's rename our last group
 * and start a new group.

	 * It should take an x and y as parameters and report
	 * if the cell has 2 or 3 neighbors.
	 * So we'll add some cells and test the scenarios.
	 * Let's name the function checkNeighbors.
	 * It will return 2, 3, or false.
	 * We con't care about numbers other than 2 or 3
	 * so we'll just return false for those.
	 * Let's add cells from top left and circle clockwise
	 * and then run checkNeighbors each time
